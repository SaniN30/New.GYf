## 1. What GYF Is (the one thing to internalize)

**GYF is an AI-native personal stylist that learns what looks good on *you* and builds
complete, coordinated outfits you can trust — getting smarter with every person it dresses.**

It is **not** a search box over a clothing catalog. It is a **learning styling
intelligence**: it perceives clothes visually, models personal taste, and generates finished
looks (top + bottom + footwear) with a clear reason behind each.

- **The market sells items. GYF delivers outfits, confidence, and taste.**
- **AI-first from day one** — intelligence is the foundation, not a feature bolted on later.
- **Trust is the product** — every recommendation is explainable with honest confidence.

### The problem
A full closet yet "nothing to wear"; apps show items but never *how to wear them together*;
constant doubt (*does this match? right for the occasion? does it suit me?*); daily decision
fatigue. A personal stylist has always been a luxury — **GYF makes that intelligence
universal: free, instant, personal.**

### Why AI-first
Styling is a **perception + preference problem**: style is *visual* (must be seen, not
tagged), taste is *personal and learned* (from behavior, continuously), and good styling
*compounds* (better the more people it dresses). A rules engine can only approximate these.

### Mission
1. **Replace anxiety with confidence.**
2. **Truly understand *you*** (taste, body, budget, occasion).
3. **Be trustworthy, not just impressive** (explainable + honest confidence).
4. **Compound intelligence** — measurably better the more it's used, for the individual and everyone.

## 2. Complete Feature Set

### Identity & accounts
- Secure sign-up, login, sessions; profile, preferences, full account control (incl. data deletion); private, per-user data.

### Cold start & onboarding
- **Zero-friction cold start:** from the very first visit — before any history — GYF suggests what looks good and which clothes suit the user.
- **Two onboarding paths, never rigid:**
  - **Photo-based:** auto-deduce skin tone and body type from a photo.
  - **Manual:** user states skin tone, body type, preferred styling, budget range, occasion.
- Preferences (especially occasion) are **always editable**.

### Intelligent personalization
- Learns style intent, colors, occasions, budget, body context; continuously-updating taste model.
- Deepens with **every** interaction, not just onboarding.
- **Matures "like a fine wine"** — results increasingly suit the user's personality, body type, skin tone, budget, and occasion; they visibly look better over time.

### AI recommendations (the heart)
- **Complete outfit generation** — top + bottom + footwear coordinated as one look.
- A clear **stylist explanation** for **every** outfit.
- **Diverse, ranked** sets (never five near-identical results).
- An honest **confidence** signal per recommendation.
- Graceful handling when a category/item is unavailable.
- **Natural-language styling goals:** a text box where the user types *"I want to look taller / broader / slimmer"*; GYF applies **color theory + body-type intelligence** to pick garments, cuts, and colors that achieve the effect.
- **Occasion-aware:** user selects the occasion (**casual, formal, wedding, festive, …**); recommendations are conditioned on it.
- **Region- & culture-aware garments:** respects regional dress (e.g. India includes sarees; the USA does not). Catalog, taxonomy, and styling logic are localized.

### Visual style understanding
- Perceives garments from images: vibe, color harmony, texture, silhouette, formality.
- Matches/coordinates by *how things actually look*, not just labels.

### Feedback & continuous learning
- Save, cart, "not interested" on any look — with easy reversal.
- Detects and resolves conflicting signals.
- Every interaction feeds the model that improves the next recommendation.

### Personal collections
- Saved-items shortlist; saved styling sessions; a **wardrobe** of what you own (styles around your real closet); history of past recommendations.

### See-it-on-you (virtual try-on)
- Select a **top + bottom + apparel/footwear** and see **all three together** on yourself.
- User provides a photo; output renders the articles on their own body.
- Must be **photo-realistic**; maturing toward true on-body preview.

### Social & inspiration (LTK-inspired — [shopltk.com](https://www.shopltk.com/))
- A dedicated **Socials page** where posts live.
- **Interactive posts:** shareable, downloadable, reactable.
- **Style sharing & following:** users upload each other's styles; a user can follow someone's style and dress like them — but **re-rendered for the follower's own skin tone and preferences**, never blindly copied.

### Profile & gamification
- Professional profile page showing outfits made and liked.
- **Badges/perks** (e.g. *Fashion Mogger*, *Trendsetter*) earned through likes, shares, comments.

### Discovery & commerce
- Explore the catalog beyond direct recommendations.
- **Buy via redirect to the parent retailer's product page.**
- **Affiliate monetization** on surfaced articles.

### Trust & transparency
- Honest, user- and operator-facing reporting of what's live, what's experimental, and how confident the system is.

### Quality protection
- Continuous evaluation so recommendation quality **provably improves** rather than silently degrading.

## 3. Business Model & Moat

- **B2C product, B2B data engine.** GYF is a B2C consumer product; in parallel, its data is distilled into a separate model sold as a **B2B service** — a second revenue line.
- **Affiliate revenue** on articles surfaced and purchases driven.
- **A real moat:** unique, differentiating, **not copyable** — the compounding learning system, proprietary taste/behavioral data, and the distilled B2B model are central.

---

## 4. Data & Datasets (efficient, low-cost)

- **Bootstrap on free/open datasets:** DeepFashion(2), Fashionpedia (items/attributes); Polyvore Outfits, Polyvore-disjoint, IQON3000 (compatibility); VITON-HD, DressCode (try-on); Fashion-Gen, FashionIQ (multimodal/language-guided).
- **Catalog** via affiliate-network / retailer **product feeds** — free and current.
- **First-party behavioral data** (saves, skips, carts, reacts, shares, follows, try-ons) is the compounding proprietary asset and the source of the B2B model.
- **Synthetic / self-generated** data balances rare body types, skin tones, occasions (fairness).
- **Cost discipline:** prefer open weights + free data; label only what behavior can't supply; cache embeddings; spend scales with proven value.

## 5. Technology Stack (summary — details in `tech-stack.md`)

> Architecture: a modular monorepo splitting the **product surface** (web + API) from the
> **ML platform** (perception, taste, ranking, generation), communicating via versioned
> contracts and an event backbone so models evolve independently of the UI.

| Layer | Primary choice | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend | **Next.js (App Router) + React 19 + TypeScript**, Tailwind + shadcn/ui, Framer Motion, tRPC | Production/professional UI from day one; accessible (WCAG 2.2); inspiration-first. |
| Backend | **Python 3.12 + FastAPI** (async); Next.js Route Handlers (BFF); gRPC + events | Same language as ML; typed contracts. |
| Data | **PostgreSQL 16** (free: Supabase/Neon) + **pgvector** → Qdrant → Milvus; Redis; **Kafka/Redpanda**; S3-compatible storage | Behavioral events are the learning backbone. |
| Auth | OIDC, JWT + refresh, WebAuthn passkeys 🔜 | Per-user private data; full deletion. |
| Serving | **NVIDIA Triton** (vision/diffusion), **vLLM** (LLM reasoning) 🔜 | GPU inference. |
| Infra | Docker + Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Terraform, MLflow, OpenTelemetry + Prometheus + Grafana + Sentry | Free-tier first (see §7). |

### The ML platform (GYF's core differentiation)
**Perceive → Model user → Control → Compose & rank → Visualize → Learn.**

1. **Visual style understanding:** `Marqo-FashionSigLIP` (fashion-tuned embeddings, +57% MRR; open/free). Color harmony scored in **CIELAB/CAM16**.
2. **User modeling from a photo — TWO separate modules:**
   - **Body-type module** — monocular **SMPL** + measurement nets → body-type taxonomy. *(well-supported)*
   - **Skin-tone module (separate, custom, fairness-gated) ⚠️** — face/skin segmentation → illumination-robust **CIELAB** tone → undertone palette; **must pass full-spectrum fairness eval** (e.g. Monk Skin Tone) before shipping; manual fallback always available. *(low-confidence; never block the product on it)*
3. **Controllable styling:** intent parser (light LLM/NLU) maps free text → visual-effect goal (`elongate`/`slim`/`broaden`); a **color-theory + body-type effects engine** turns goals into garment-attribute constraints that re-weight the ranker and feed explanations. Occasion + region/culture are first-class conditioning features.
4. **Personal taste & recommendation:** launch with **two-tower retrieval + transformer ranker**; content-based **cold start**; scale to **generative recommendation with Semantic IDs (TIGER/HSTU)**. Every rec ships a reason + calibrated confidence.
5. **Outfit composition & compatibility:** transformer-over-the-outfit-set (+ hypergraph GNN) compatibility scorer; constrained, **diverse (DPP/MMR)** ranked outfits honoring budget/occasion/body/tone/wardrobe.
6. **Generative virtual try-on:** **IDM-VTON** baseline → **MuGa-VTON** (multi-garment diffusion transformer); **CatVTON** efficiency option. Photo-realistic, multi-garment.
7. **Continuous learning & quality:** event-sourced feedback → feature store → retraining; **offline metrics for candidate selection only**, promotion gated by **online A/B + interleaving + counterfactual/IPS**; drift monitoring, shadow deploys, auto-rollback. Never silently regress.

### Social, commerce, B2B
- Ranked social feed on the same taste/embedding stack; style-following re-rendered to the follower's tone; badge engine; "shop the look" → retailer redirect + affiliate attribution; moderation via VLM/policy classifiers.
- **B2B engine:** event lake → privacy-preserving aggregation (DP + k-anonymity 🔜) → trend/taste/demand features → distilled models served via a versioned partner API, strictly separated from PII.

## 6. Phased Rollout (matches the product arc)

| Phase | Ships |
| --- | --- |
| **1 — Intelligent stylist (launch)** | Onboarding (photo/manual, separate body + skin-tone modules), cold start, explained outfits, occasion + NL styling goals, region-aware garments, feedback loop, basic try-on (IDM-VTON), social posts, affiliate redirect. |
| **2 — Personal taste engine** | Wardrobe-aware styling, deeper personalization, context (weather/event/mood), badges; Semantic-ID generative recsys (beta). |
| **3 — Shopping companion** | Multi-retailer recommendations, smarter buying, richer commerce. |
| **4 — Visualization layer** | High-fidelity multi-garment on-body try-on (MuGa-VTON). |
| **5 — Ambient stylist + B2B** | Compounding collective intelligence (HSTU scale), B2B data product. |

## 7. Engineering & Operating Principles (non-negotiable)

1. **AI-first.** Visual understanding + learned taste is the foundation.
2. **Always explainable.** Human-readable reason + honest confidence; never a black box.
3. **Learn continuously.** Real behavior is the most valuable asset — capture it cleanly.
4. **Personal and private.** Deep personalization; each user's data protected and theirs.
5. **Outfits, not items.** Always think in complete, coordinated looks.
6. **Quality must provably rise.** Evaluate continuously; never silently regress.
7. **Trust is the product.** Impressiveness without trust is failure.
8. **Inspiration-first frontend.** Frontend relies on backend endpoints; **production/professional standards from the start** — QoL features, high-end design patterns, high interactiveness and intuitiveness.
9. **Beta-ready, scale-ready.** Build for a handful of beta users, then scale — **no compromises, no hardcoded limitations**; keep future scaling in mind from day one.
10. **State-of-the-art, free, and latest.** Cutting-edge tech that is free and current, accounting for efficiency, optimization, and security.
11. **Best practices throughout.** Strong programming principles and design patterns.
12. **Genuine and usable.** Everything real, functional, genuinely usable — **no mockups masquerading as features**.
13. **Plan before build.** Detailed plan first; **nothing is implemented before the plan exists.**
14. **Research before choosing.** Research the full landscape before adopting any technology/technique; implement the best researched option.
15. **Free-tier first, cost-disciplined.** Use free tiers/options until scale forces a paid move (or there's genuinely no free path). Spend only when scale demands it.
16. **Leverage ECC skills.** Use relevant skills from the `ECC` folder whenever they apply.

### Free-tier deployment path (cost-disciplined)
- **$0 beta:** web on **Vercel / Cloudflare Workers**; DB+vectors on **Supabase / Neon** (free pgvector); GPU inference on **Hugging Face Spaces + ZeroGPU**.
- **Bridge to scale:** **Modal** ($30/mo credit) / **RunPod** for try-on bursts.
- **At scale:** dedicated GPU + Qdrant/Milvus, only when usage forces it.
- *Avoid for GPU:* Fly.io, Railway. (Quotas change — verify at signup.)

### Which ECC skills to use when
- **Planning:** `ecc:plan`, `ecc:plan-prd` (always plan before building).
- **Research:** `ecc:deep-research` before adopting a new technology.
- **Code review:** `react-reviewer`, `python-reviewer`, `typescript-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`.
- **ML:** `mle-reviewer`, `eval-harness`.
- **Frontend quality/a11y:** `accessibility`, `a11y-architect`, `frontend-design-direction`.
- **Architecture:** `architect`, `code-architect`.

## 8. Working Agreement for Agents

- **Read the source docs first** (`ideas-complete.md`, `tech-stack.md`, `research/deep-research-report.md`) before proposing or building anything.
- **Plan before code.** Surface a plan; do not implement until it's agreed.
- **No mockups.** Ship genuinely functional work.
- **Default to free/open** tools and models; flag when a paid step is unavoidable.
- **Keep docs in lockstep.** When `ideas*.md` change, fold them into `ideas-complete.md`; reflect product changes in `tech-stack.md`; update this file's summaries. The source docs are authoritative.
- **Flag the known risks:** fair/robust **skin-tone** estimation (separate ⚠️ module) and the **offline→online metric gap** in recommendation (gate releases with online + counterfactual eval).
