## 0. Framing

GYF starts new. It is **not** a continuation of a rules-based system with ML bolted on
later. It is conceived from the first line as an **AI-first product**: intelligence is
the foundation, not an upgrade. This is a *vision and direction* brief that deliberately
stays above low-level implementation, while setting firm engineering principles.

---

## 1. The One-Line Idea

**GYF is an AI-native personal stylist that learns what looks good on *you* and builds
complete, coordinated outfits you can trust — getting smarter with every person it
dresses.**

It is not a search box over a clothing catalog. It is a **learning styling
intelligence**: it perceives clothes visually, models your personal taste, and generates
finished looks (top + bottom + footwear) with a clear reason behind each.

---

## 2. The Problem We're Solving

Almost everyone lives the same quiet daily friction:

- A full closet, yet "nothing to wear."
- Shopping apps show single items but never *how to wear them together*.
- Constant doubt: *Does this match? Is it right for the occasion? Does it suit me?*
- Decision fatigue, every morning.

A personal stylist — someone who knows what flatters you, what coordinates, and what's
worth buying — has always been a luxury for the few. **GYF makes that intelligence
universal: free, instant, and personal to everyone.**

The market sells *items*. GYF delivers *outfits*, *confidence*, and *taste*.

---

## 3. Why AI-First, From the Start

Styling is at its core a **perception and preference problem** — exactly what modern AI
is built for:

- **Style is visual.** You can't capture "this jacket has the right vibe" with tags and
  rules. It has to be *seen*. So GYF perceives clothing from images.
- **Taste is personal and learned.** No fixed rulebook captures an individual's taste.
  It must be *learned from behavior* — and updated continuously.
- **Good styling compounds.** The more people it dresses and the more reactions it sees,
  the better it should get. That's a learning system, not a static one.

A rules engine could only ever approximate these. GYF treats intelligence as the
foundation, with transparent explanations layered on top for trust — not the other way
around.

---

## 4. Mission — What GYF Wants to Achieve

1. **Replace anxiety with confidence.** The outcome isn't more clothes — it's a person
   who feels put-together and stops second-guessing.
2. **Truly understand *you*.** Learn each user's taste, body, budget, and occasions so
   deeply that advice feels personal, like a stylist who knows you.
3. **Be trustworthy, not just impressive.** Every recommendation is explainable and
   honest about its confidence. Trust is the product.
4. **Compound intelligence.** Become measurably better the more it's used — for the
   individual and for everyone.

---

## 5. The Complete Feature Set

### Identity & Accounts
- Secure sign-up, login, and sessions
- Profile, preferences, and full account control (including data deletion)
- Private, per-user data

### Cold Start & Onboarding
- **Zero-friction cold start.** From the very first visit — before any history exists —
  GYF immediately suggests what looks good on the user and which clothes suit them.
- **Two onboarding paths, never rigid:**
  - **Photo-based:** the user uploads a photo and the system automatically deduces skin
    tone and body type.
  - **Manual:** the user directly states their skin tone, body type, preferred styling,
    budget range, and the occasion they're dressing for.
- Preferences (especially occasion) are **always editable** — the user can change them at
  any time. Nothing is locked in.

### Intelligent Personalization
- Learns style intent, colors, occasions, budget, and body context
- Builds a continuously-updating model of each user's taste
- Personalization deepens with every interaction, not just at onboarding
- **Matures like a fine wine.** The more the person uses GYF, the more their taste and
  preferences refine — so results increasingly suit their **personality, body type, skin
  tone, budget, and occasion**, and they visibly look better and more themselves over time

### AI Recommendations (the heart)
- Complete outfit generation — top + bottom + footwear coordinated as one look
- A clear stylist explanation for **every** outfit
- Diverse, ranked sets of looks (never five near-identical results)
- An honest confidence signal on each recommendation
- Graceful handling when a category or item is unavailable
- **Natural-language styling goals.** At recommendation time, a text box lets the user
  state a goal in plain words — *"I want to look taller / broader / slimmer"* — and GYF
  intelligently applies **color theory + body-type intelligence** to choose garments,
  cuts, and colors that achieve that visual effect.
- **Occasion-aware.** The user specifies the occasion (e.g. **casual, formal, wedding,
  festive, …**) and recommendations are conditioned on it.
- **Region- & culture-aware garments.** Recommendations respect regional dress: e.g.
  India includes sarees where the USA does not. The catalog, taxonomy, and styling logic
  are localized to the user's region and culture.

### Visual Style Understanding
- Perceives garments from images: vibe, color harmony, texture, silhouette, formality
- Matches and coordinates by *how things actually look*, not just labels

### Feedback & Continuous Learning
- Save, cart, and "not interested" on any look — with easy reversal
- Detects and resolves conflicting signals
- Every interaction feeds the model that makes the next recommendation better

### Personal Collections
- Saved items shortlist
- Saved styling sessions to revisit
- A wardrobe of what you already own (so it styles around your real closet)
- A history of what GYF has recommended

### Discovery & Commerce
- Explore the catalog beyond direct recommendations
- A path from "I love this look" to acting on it (cart / purchase intent)
- **Buy through the platform:** the user can purchase any article by being redirected to
  its parent (retailer's) product page
- **Affiliate monetization:** articles surfaced in GYF carry affiliate links — GYF earns
  on the purchases it drives

### Social & Inspiration (LTK-inspired)
- Inspiration-led experience inspired by [LTK](https://www.shopltk.com/): shoppable
  looks, creator/curator feeds, and a discovery surface that turns inspiration into
  action
- **A dedicated Socials page** where posts live
- **Interactive, shareable posts:** every post is shareable, downloadable, and reactable
- **Style sharing & following:** people upload each other's styles so a user can follow
  someone's style and dress like them — but always re-rendered for the follower's own
  skin tone and preferences, not copied blindly
- Social layer for sharing, following, and shopping others' looks

### Profile & Gamification
- A polished, **professional profile page** showing the outfits a user has made and the
  outfits they've liked
- **User perks and badges** — e.g. *Fashion Mogger*, *Trendsetter* — earned through
  likes, shares, and comments, rewarding engagement and influence

### See-It-On-You (Virtual Try-On)
- The user selects a top, a bottom, and apparel/footwear and sees **all three together**
  on themselves
- The user provides a photo as input; the output renders the selected articles on their
  own body
- Must be **photo-realistic** — giving a genuinely accurate idea of what fit and which
  garments actually look good on the user
- Maturing toward true, high-fidelity on-body preview

### Trust & Transparency
- Honest, user- and operator-facing reporting of what's live, what's experimental, and
  how confident the system is

### Quality Protection
- Continuous evaluation so recommendation quality provably improves over time rather
  than silently degrading

## 6. The Cutting-Edge Technology Vision

This is GYF's core differentiation and where it invests from the start.

1. **Visual style intelligence.** See and understand clothing the way a stylist does —
   reading aesthetic, texture, color, and silhouette directly from imagery — so
   coordination is based on real visual harmony.
2. **Deep personal-taste modeling.** A living, individual representation of each user's
   preferences that anticipates what they'll love before they see it and refines with
   every signal.
3. **Collective intelligence, personalized.** Learn from how thousands of people react
   to combinations to discover styling patterns no rulebook contains — then tailor those
   insights back to the individual.
4. **Generative and on-body visualization.** Move toward realistic rendering of how a
   look appears on *your* body, turning "I think this works" into "I can see that it
   does."
5. **A compounding stylist.** The north star: an intelligence that gets sharper the more
   people it dresses — every outfit, save, and skip improving the next recommendation
   for everyone.

**Trust as a first-class feature.** Even as an AI-first product, GYF always pairs
intelligence with explanation and honest confidence. The advanced models are
continuously evaluated against quality benchmarks so the system earns and keeps user
trust. Sophistication and transparency advance *together*.

---

## 7. The Long-Term Vision (The Arc)

- **Phase 1 — The intelligent stylist (launch).** An AI that builds personalized,
  explained outfits from day one and learns from real user behavior immediately.
- **Phase 2 — The personal taste engine.** GYF knows your style deeply enough that its
  picks feel uncannily *you*. It styles around your real wardrobe and adapts to context
  (weather, event, mood).
- **Phase 3 — The shopping companion.** GYF shops *with* you — across brands and
  retailers — recommending not just looks but the smartest things to buy to complete
  your wardrobe, within your budget.
- **Phase 4 — The visualization layer.** See any look realistically on yourself before
  committing — removing the last barrier between inspiration and confidence.
- **Phase 5 — The ambient stylist.** GYF becomes the default way people decide what to
  wear and what to buy — a trusted companion present wherever fashion decisions happen,
  getting smarter for everyone it serves.

---

## 7.5. Business Model & Moat

- **B2C product, B2B data engine.** GYF itself is a **B2C** consumer product. In parallel,
  all the data it collects is distilled, compiled, and concentrated into a separate model
  that GYF can sell as a **B2B service** — a second, defensible revenue line on top of the
  consumer app.
- **Affiliate revenue.** GYF earns through affiliate links on the articles it surfaces and
  the purchases it drives (see *Discovery & Commerce*).
- **A real moat.** GYF must have unique, differentiating points and must **not be
  copyable** by anyone — the compounding learning system, proprietary taste data, and
  distilled B2B model are central to that defensibility.

---

## 7.6. Data & Datasets — Acquisition Strategy (efficient & low-cost)

GYF is data-hungry by design, but data must be acquired **cheaply and legally**, favoring
free/open sources first and proprietary data generated as a by-product of usage.

- **Bootstrap on free/open fashion datasets.** Start from public corpora for garments,
  attributes, outfits, and try-on — e.g. large fashion product/attribute sets, outfit
  compatibility sets, and try-on benchmark datasets — to train perception, compatibility,
  and try-on models before any users exist.
- **Catalog via retailer/affiliate feeds.** Pull product imagery + metadata from affiliate
  networks and retailer product feeds (the same partners that monetize purchases) — free,
  current, and continuously refreshed.
- **The real moat is first-party behavioral data.** Every save, skip, cart, react, share,
  follow, and try-on is captured cleanly and becomes proprietary training signal no
  competitor has. This is the compounding asset and the source of the B2B model.
- **Synthetic & self-generated data.** Use the generative/try-on stack to augment scarce
  cases (rare body types, skin tones, occasions) and to balance datasets for fairness.
- **Cost discipline.** Prefer open weights and free datasets; label only what behavior
  can't supply; cache embeddings; avoid expensive re-computation. Data spend scales with
  proven value, never speculatively.

## 8. Product & Design Principles

1. **Inspiration-first frontend.** The frontend is built on an inspirational basis: its
   design and build rely on the backend (the endpoints). The UI/UX must be of
   **production and professional standards from the very beginning** — quality-of-life
   features, high-end design patterns, and high interactiveness and intuitiveness.
2. **Outfits, not items.** Always think in complete, coordinated looks.
3. **Always explainable.** Every recommendation carries a human-readable reason and an
   honest confidence — never a black box.
4. **Trust is the product.** Impressiveness without trust is failure.

---

## 9. Engineering & Operating Principles

1. **AI-first.** Intelligence (visual understanding + learned taste) is the foundation,
   not a feature added later.
2. **Learn continuously.** Real user behavior is the most valuable asset; capture it
   cleanly and let the product improve from it.
3. **Personal and private.** Deeply personalized, with each user's data protected and
   their own.
4. **Quality must provably rise.** Evaluate continuously; never let the experience
   silently regress.
5. **Beta-ready, scale-ready.** Build for a handful of beta users first, then scale out
   as users grow — with **no compromises and no hardcoded limitations**. Keep future
   scaling in mind from day one.
6. **State-of-the-art, free, and latest.** Use cutting-edge technologies that are free
   and current, while accounting for efficiency, optimization, and security of the
   entire platform, codebase, and code.
7. **Best practices throughout.** Follow strong programming principles and design
   patterns for all development.
8. **Genuine and usable.** Everything developed must be real, functional, and genuinely
   usable — no mockups masquerading as features.
9. **Leverage ECC skills.** Use all relevant skills from the `ECC` folder whenever they
   apply.
10. **Plan before building.** All programming and development must follow a detailed plan;
    **nothing is implemented before that plan exists.**
11. **Research before choosing.** Before adopting any technology or technique, research the
    full landscape of options and implement the best researched solution — not the first
    one found.
12. **Cutting-edge and professional.** Every solution must be cutting-edge and implemented
    to a genuinely professional standard.
13. **Free-tier first, cost-disciplined.** For deployment, hosting, and tooling, use free
    tiers and free/open options until user scale forces a paid move — or until there is
    genuinely no free path. Spend only when scale demands it; never prematurely.
